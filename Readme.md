## ⚡ What does it do?

AxePower manages your laptop's power settings and refresh rates based on whether your charger is plugged in or unplugged. 

Have you ever noticed your laptop running slowly when unplugged, or your battery draining too fast? AxePower solves this by offering dedicated modes:

- 🔋 **Eco Mode:** Saves battery so your laptop runs longer when you are away from the charger.
- ⚖️ **Smart Mode:** The perfect middle ground for everyday tasks like browsing and watching videos.
- 🚀 **Beast Mode:** Gives you maximum power and sustained clocks for gaming or heavy tasks when plugged in.
- 🎮 **Game Mode:** Automatically detects running games across any drive, suspends background bloat, locks maximum display refresh rate, and offers Controller Navigation (Gopher360).
- 🎵 **Music Player:** In-app audio player supporting local audio libraries, YouTube streaming, Spotify controller, and a dashboard-integrated Header Player.
- 🖥️ **Share Screen:** Browser-based low-latency desktop and gameplay streaming with zero setup for viewers.
- 📱 **Phone Control:** All-in-one mobile suite with offline **LAN Drop** Wi-Fi file sharing and **scrcpy** Android screen mirroring.
- 🛍️ **Software Hub & Updaters:** 1-click installer and launcher for gaming stores, hardware monitoring tools, Ninite multi-installer, drivers, and runtimes.
- 🧰 **System Care:** Recommended optimizations, SFC/DISM repairs, cleanup, DNS tools, restore points, and live terminal output in one workspace.
- 🛡️ **Windows Update Controls:** Apply the security-only update policy, protect signed-in sessions from forced reboots, repair update services/cache, and create restore points.
- 🖥️ **Built-In Terminal:** A real CMD / PowerShell window inside AxePower, where every command the app runs shows its live output.
- 🌡️ **True CPU & GPU Temperatures:** Reads your machine's real sensors — and keeps working on Windows 11 PCs with Memory Integrity turned on, where most monitoring tools show nothing.

**The best part?** You can turn on **Auto Switch**, and AxePower will automatically switch between these modes for you. Out-of-the-box, it defaults to **Smart Mode** when plugged in and **Eco Mode** on battery for optimal balance, or you can choose your own defaults!

## 🌟 What's New in v2.1.0

- 🧰 **Unified System Care**: Optimizer and Doctor now share a focused workspace with a collapsible category rail, recommended tweaks, guarded repair actions, junk cleanup, DNS tools, restore points, and live terminal output.
- 🛡️ **Working Windows Update controls**: apply the recommended security-updates-only policy, block forced restarts while a user is signed in, reset the Windows Update cache and services, and create a restore point before changes.
- 🗂️ **Table-based Uninstaller**: separate Win32 and Windows Apps views use the full page width, show each application's type, and support sortable columns, alphabetical order in both directions, batch selection, broken-entry filtering, and Select All for leftovers.
- 🧭 **Responsive Software Hub**: categories move into a collapsible left rail. Install and app actions stay on the right when space permits and move below details only when the window is compact.
- 🔔 **Notifications & Alerts**: desktop banners, automatic-mode-change notices, and the low-battery chime now follow persistent settings and live runtime events.
- 🎮 **Clear mode selection**: only the applied mode remains active; choosing Eco, Smart, or Beast previews its glow before Apply. Game Mode no longer makes Smart appear active.
- 🧹 **Navigation cleanup**: Maintenance contains Windows Update, System Care, Uninstaller, and Debloat; Utilities contains Terminal and Tools.
- 👤 **Accounts, Friends, Tools & Routines included**: v2.1.0 also includes the optional account/profile system, friends and invitations, expanded trusted tools, Timer, and If-Then Routines introduced in the 2.0.x updates.
- 📦 **Installer**: **`AxePower-v2.1.0-Setup.exe`** for Windows 10/11 x64.

## 🌟 What's New in v1.9.0

- 🎵 **Integrated Music Player & Media Hub**:
  - Full in-app audio playback engine with queue management, track progress, volume control, and background playback.
  - **YouTube & Spotify Integration**: Stream audio directly from YouTube and manage Spotify playback right from AxePower.
  - **Dashboard Header Player**: Sleek mini-player embedded seamlessly in the top header matching the dashboard aesthetic.
  - **Dynamic Audio Device Following**: Automatically follows default Windows output audio device transitions without requiring an app restart.
- 🖥️ **Share Screen & GameStream**:
  - Stream your active desktop or gaming session directly to friends via a local web link.
  - Viewers connect straight from any modern browser with low latency and synchronized audio — no external client downloads required.
  - Stability fixes for CamStudio and spacedesk virtual display resets.
- 🗑️ **Next-Gen Uninstaller Pro Engine**:
  - Overhauled leftover scanner featuring confidence scoring, deep registry/filesystem probes, and pre-clean safety backup manifests.
  - Dedicated **Broken Entry Executor** to purge corrupted and orphaned Windows registry uninstallation remnants.
  - Expanded heuristics covering Win32 setups, MSI installers, Squirrel frameworks, and modern Windows AppX/MSIX packages.
- 🔋 **Battery View Diagnostics Optimization**:
  - Streamlined battery history card layout with responsive sparklines and cleaner metrics presentation.
  - Fixed binding errors and settings churn during dashboard load for faster initial rendering.
- 🧭 **UX & Navigation Enhancements**:

  - Installer refreshed as **`AxePower-v1.9.0-Setup.exe`**, bootstrapping the .NET 8 Desktop Runtime and cleanly updating existing installations.

## 🌟 What's New in v1.8.0

- 🖥️ **Built-In Terminal (CMD & PowerShell)**:
  - A new **Terminal** page under *Maintenance* running a persistent interactive shell — switch between **PowerShell** and **Command Prompt**, type commands, and get real output.
  - It is now the one place AxePower's own commands report to: **Software Hub** installs and upgrades and **System Doctor** diagnostics (SFC / DISM / DNS benchmark) stream their progress here instead of hiding it behind a spinner.
  - A **Stop** button cancels whatever is running, including the long background diagnostics started from another page.
  - The shell inherits AxePower's privilege level, so when the app is elevated the terminal is elevated too.
- 🛡️ **Run as Administrator — Properly**:
  - New **Run as administrator** toggle in *Settings* (on by default), plus a **Relaunch with Admin** button in the title bar that disappears once you are already elevated.
  - AxePower keeps an `asInvoker` manifest and elevates by relaunching itself, so unlike most tools the setting can actually be switched **off**.
  - The logon task is registered at `HighestAvailable`, which means AxePower starts elevated at boot with **no UAC prompt at all**.
  - A refused UAC prompt no longer loops — the app simply carries on as a standard user.
- 🌡️ **Real CPU & GPU Temperatures That Survive Memory Integrity**:
  - New three-tier sensor stack, tried in order of reliability:
    1. **Lenovo ACPI-WMI firmware** (`LENOVO_GAMEZONE_DATA`) — needs no kernel driver, the same interface Lenovo Vantage and Legion Toolkit use.
    2. **MSI Afterburner shared memory** — free to read, no elevation required, and the numbers match what Afterburner already shows you.
    3. **LibreHardwareMonitor** — the traditional MSR route via its own kernel driver.
  - This matters: on current Windows 11 the MSR driver (WinRing0) is on Microsoft's vulnerable-driver blocklist, so with **Memory Integrity** enabled — the default on new machines — MSR-only tools silently report nothing. AxePower now falls through to a route that still works.
  - The UI says so when a reading comes from the ACPI chassis zone rather than the processor die, instead of passing an ambient number off as your CPU temperature.
- 💾 **One-Click System Restore Point**:
  - Create a Windows restore point from the Software Hub before making changes. AxePower enables System Restore on the system drive and lifts the once-per-24-hours throttle first, so the checkpoint is genuinely written rather than silently skipped.
- 🪟 **New Glass Theme (Mica & Acrylic)**:
  - The old *Transparent* theme is replaced by **Glass**, built on the real Windows 11 DWM backdrops, with an Acrylic blur-behind fallback for Windows 10 and early Windows 11 builds.
  - Existing settings files that still say `Transparent` migrate to `Glass` automatically — nothing to reconfigure.
  - Light, Dark and System themes were retuned alongside it.
- 🧭 **Dashboard Quick Actions Now Deep-Link**:
  - Dashboard tiles jump straight to the exact destination — e.g. a Gaming Runtimes tile opens the Software Hub already on the *Apps* tab with the *Gaming* category selected, rather than dropping you on a generic page.
  - Software Hub category chips now filter the list correctly when clicked.
- 🧰 **Portability & Housekeeping**:
  - Removed developer-machine paths that were baked into the shipped build — the Ninite launcher now resolves next to the installed executable, so it behaves the same for every user.
  - NVIDIA / AMD control-panel launchers are resolved through the Windows folder constants instead of a literal `C:\Program Files`, so they work on machines where Windows is not installed on C:.
  - Installer refreshed as **`AxePower-v1.8.0-Setup.exe`**, still bootstrapping the .NET 8 Desktop Runtime and cleanly removing older installs.
