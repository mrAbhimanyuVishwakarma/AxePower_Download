## ⚡ What does it do?

AxePower manages your laptop's power settings and refresh rates based on whether your charger is plugged in or unplugged. 

Have you ever noticed your laptop running slowly when unplugged, or your battery draining too fast? AxePower solves this by offering dedicated modes:

- 🔋 **Eco Mode:** Saves battery so your laptop runs longer when you are away from the charger.
- ⚖️ **Smart Mode:** The perfect middle ground for everyday tasks like browsing and watching videos.
- 🚀 **Beast Mode:** Gives you maximum power and sustained clocks for gaming or heavy tasks when plugged in.
- 🎮 **Game Mode:** Automatically detects running games across any drive, suspends background bloat, locks maximum display refresh rate, and offers Controller Navigation (Gopher360).
- 📱 **Phone Control:** All-in-one mobile suite with offline **LAN Drop** Wi-Fi file sharing and **scrcpy** Android screen mirroring.
- 🛍️ **Software Hub & Updaters:** 1-click installer and launcher for gaming stores, hardware monitoring tools, Ninite multi-installer, drivers, and runtimes.

**The best part?** You can turn on **Auto Switch**, and AxePower will automatically switch between these modes for you. Out-of-the-box, it defaults to **Smart Mode** when plugged in and **Eco Mode** on battery for optimal balance, or you can choose your own defaults!
